# Fuzzer SDK for regular people

This repo is intended as a test case for creating a python general purpose SDK for building fuzzers;

The intention of this framework is to be executed in a distributed environment in which each node orchestrates its fuzzing sessions internally.

A shared location is used to commute the next data elements:
* Samples Corpus for input to the fuzzing
* Logging repository
* Coverage and statistics repository
* Crash repository 

### Main components
The SDK composed of the next components:
* Main Fuzzer dispatcher with life cycle awareness & resource monitoring ‚ö°Ô∏è
* Generator strategy provider - serving the fuzzer with samples from corpus(es) ‚ö°Ô∏è
* Logging Service collecting and minimizing fuzzing run logs üì¨
* Coverage Service collecting and minimizing fuzzing run statistics  üì¨
* Crash analyzer Service collecting analyzing crash üì¨
